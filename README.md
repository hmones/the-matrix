# The Matrix - Red Pill Challenge

The project is built using react and is inspired by the matrix theme to provide a challenge of war stereotypes. With each image chosen, there's a lesson learned and a stereotype that is broken. With answering the 9 questions of the challenge, a user is shown his/her/their Matrix charachter based on their score.
